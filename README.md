# Connector Assembly Robot Project

## Overview
The Connector Assembly Robot project integrates mechanical, electrical, and computer vision systems to automate and streamline the assembly process. The computer vision algorithms were developed using QT and C++ to ensure the correct placement of rings and connectors.

This figure shows how the various components are arranged inside the connector to prevent fuel leakage. Figure A1 is a secure ring, A2 is a yellow ring, A3 is a spacer, A4 is a green ring, and A5 is a key, that is used to separate the pin and the connector. Figures B and C show the placement and arrangement of the components, and Figure D shows the location of the key.

## How It Works
The computer vision system ensures that the correct order, color, and shape of rings and connectors are placed on the carrier. Failed images are stored in memory for further analysis.
